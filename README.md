# Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) program
This is a program that was created during my school period.
The primary responsibility of crime scene investigators (CSIs) is to investigate crimes by carefully collecting and analyzing physical evidence. They may collect hair, tissue, and body fluids from a crime victim, or perform tests on items found at a crime scene. In short, they analyze all of the evidence in the interest of providing accurate information that may help to acquit or to convict a person of a crime

## Usage
```
The restriction_GUI_v2.py Python3.6.1 script is executed. This will activate the program and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) will show in front of the screen. To upload the input file (CSI_casus.fa), the file button is clicked . A few enzymes are selected to digest the DNA sequences. Finally, the digest button is clicked to perform the digestion
```

## Results
```
The GUI will now show multiple lines (which are also called bands) with the correspondent victims and perpetrator. In order to find the one person that is responsible for the crime, you need to follow the lines which matches the lines of the perpetrator.
```

The GUI shows multiple lines (which are also called bands) with the correspondent victims and perpetrator. In order to find the one person that is responsible for the crime, you need to follow the lines which matches the lines of the perpetrator. A video is created in order to show how this works. This can be found in the video directory.
